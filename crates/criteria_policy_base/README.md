This is a helper crate that allows to easily scaffold a policy that validates a
list of strings using a well defined list of criteria.

The allowed criteria are:

- `containsAnyOf`
- `doesNotContainAllOf`
- `containsAllOf`
- `doesNotContainAllOf`
- `containsOtherThan`
- `doesNotContainOtherThan`

Right now we expect this library to be consumed by policies that are validating
environment variables, labels and annotations.

## Rules operators logic tables

These are some tables to help you understand the logic of the operators:

### `containsAnyOf`

Given these `environmentVariables` settings: `[a, b]`

| Resource environment variables | Evaluation result |

## How to use the library

The errors messages contain the name of the resource the final policy
evaluates.

The name of the resource being evaluated is set inside of `lib.rs` and
is set by looking at the presence of specific feature flags.

The settings of the real policy is driven by the structure of the `settings::BaseSettings`
enumeration:

```yaml
settings:
  criteria: "containsAnyOf"
  values:
    - MARIADB_USER
    - MARIADB_PASSWORD
```

More work would be needed if the real policy needs other setting values.

The actual validation is then done by the `validate::validate_values` function
that must be called by the real policy.
