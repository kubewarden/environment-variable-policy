    # environment-variable-policy

    The environment-variable-policy can be used to inspect environment variables
    defined in the resources deployed in the cluster. It's able to validate both
    variables names and values. The policy allows the users define multiple validation rules.
    And the resource must pass **all** the rules to be allowed in the cluster.

    The policy can either target Pods, or workload resources (Deployments, ReplicaSets,
    DaemonSets, ReplicationControllers, Jobs, CronJobs). Both have trade-offs:

    - Policy targets Pods: Different kind of resources (be them native or CRDs) can
      create Pods. By having the policy target Pods, we guarantee that all the Pods
      are going to be compliant, even those created from CRDs. However, this could
      lead to confusion among users, as high level Kubernetes resources would be
      successfully created, but they would stay in a non reconciled state.
      Example: a Deployment creating a non-compliant Pod would be created, but it
      would never have all its replicas running.

    - Policy targets workload resources (e.g: Deployment): the policy inspect higher
      order resource (e.g. Deployment): users will get immediate feedback about rejections.
      However, non compliant pods created by another high level resource (be it native
      to Kubernetes, or a CRD), may not get rejected.

    This policy is able to load environment variables values defined using the [`valueFrom`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#envvar-v1-core) field.
    However, only values defined using the [`fieldRef`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#envvarsource-v1-core)
    and pointing to the resource fields from the following list are supported:

    - "metadata.name": load value from the `name` field from the resources's metadata
    - "metadata.namespace": load value from the `namespace` field from the resources's metadata
    - "metadata.labels['KEY']": load value from the `labels` field from the resources's metadata. The `KEY` is the label name
    - "metadata.annotations['KEY']": load value from the `annotations` field from the resources's metadata. The `KEY` is the annotation name
    - "spec.nodeName": load value from the `nodeName` field from the resource's pod specification
    - "spec.serviceAccountName": load value from the `serviceAccountName` field from the resource's pod specification

    It's important to mention that the value used in the validation is what is defined at the time
    of the resource creation. Not the actual value used when the resource is deployed. This happens
    because Kubernetes get values from the Pod. Not from the high level resource to populate
    the environment variables pointing to other fields.

    ## Settings

    Each rule defined in the policy settings is composed by a `reject` operator and a set
    of the environment variable used with the operator against the environment variables
    from the resources. The rules are evaluated in the order that they are defined.
    The resource is denied in the first failed evaluated rule. The following yaml is a settings example:

    ```yaml
    settings:
      rules:
        - reject: anyIn
          environmentVariables:
            - name: "envvar1"
              value: "envvar1_value"
            - name: "envvar2"
              value: "envvar2_value"

    ```

    The supported `reject` operator are:


    - `anyIn` (default): checks if any of the `environmentVariables` are in the Pod/Workload resource
    - `anyNotIn`: checks if any of the `environmentVariables` are not in the Pod/Workload resource
    - `allAreUsed`: checks if all of the `environmentVariables` are in the Pod/Workload resource
    - `notAllAreUsed`: checks if all of the `environmentVariables` are not in the Pod/Workload resource

    The environment variables are defined as objects:
    ```yaml
    - name: "variable name"
      value: "variable value"
    ```

    The name should follow the  [C_IDENTIFIER](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#envvar-v1-core)
    standard and the `value` field is optional. When it is not define the `""` value is used by default.

    It is not allowed define a rule with an empty `environmentVariables` list.

    ## Examples

    In the following example, the resources that have least one of the variables will be denied:

    ```yaml
    settings:
      rules:
        - reject: anyIn
          environmentVariables:
            - name: "envvar1"
            - name: "envvar2"

    ```

    In the following example, the resources cannot use both environment variables at once, only one or the other

    ```yaml
    settings:
      rules:
        - reject: allAreUsed
          environmentVariables:
            - name: "envvar2"
              value: ""
    ```

    In the following example, only resources that have the `envvar3` or `envvar2` defined will be allowed:

    ```yaml
    settings:
      rules:
        - reject: anyNotIn
          environmentVariables:
            - name: "envvar2"
              value: "envvar2_value"
            - name: "envvar3"
    ```

    In the following example, the resources can use both variables at once, but not only one of them

    ```yaml
    settings:
      rules:
        - reject: notAllAreUsed
          environmentVariables:
            - name: "envvar3"
              value: "envvar3_value"
            - name: "envvar4"
              value: "envvar4_value"
    ```
